✅ ✨Website Prompt: “SpaceKo” Full Visual Prototype✨
Build a fully responsive website called “SpaceKo: Campus Resource Locator” using React and Tailwind CSS. This app is designed for students at PUP Main to check and report real-time availability of campus spaces like classrooms, labs, and study areas.

🌈 THEME & VISUALS:
Use a clean, minimal UI with a warm linen background (#FAF0E6) as the base.

Accent colors:

Maroon (#800000) — for headers, buttons, icons.

Gold (#FFD700) — for highlights, labels, hover states.

Green (#28a745) — to represent “Available”.

Red (#dc3545) — to represent “Occupied”.

Use rounded cards, soft shadows, and a grid layout.

Add subtle hover animations and transitions.

🏠 HOME PAGE STRUCTURE:
🔺 Top Navbar
App name: SpaceKo

Small tagline: Empowering PUPians with Real-Time Space Visibility

Navigation buttons (not functional yet): Home | About | Report | Map

Mobile responsive (hamburger menu)

🗂️ Resource Grid Section
Display a responsive grid of resource cards (classrooms, labs, etc.).

Each card shows:

Room name (e.g., “Room 202”)

Status badge: “Available” (green) or “Occupied” (red)

Last updated timestamp (e.g., “Updated 10 mins ago”)

A “Report Status” button (no actual backend yet — opens a fake modal or toast)

📍 Static Map Section
Below the resource grid, include a static PNG map (placeholder like pup-map.png) inside a container with a legend:

Green Dot = Available

Red Dot = Occupied

Optional: Add absolute-positioned icons/markers if possible

🧾 “Report Status” Modal (popup or component)
Simple form:

Dropdown to choose space (Room 101, etc.)

Select status: Available / Occupied

Submit button (just updates mock state for now)

Optional toast: “Thanks for reporting!”

🌟 Sidebar or Section: “Community Spotlight”
Showcase a few mock users (e.g., "JuanDLC", "Iskolar08") who updated 3+ times today.

Simple card layout with user avatars (random or emojis), update count.

📱 Mobile Responsive Layout:
Stack layout for smaller screens.

Collapsible nav, full-width cards, static map scales down with padding.

⚙️ Functionality:
Use mock JSON data to simulate room statuses and updates (e.g., /src/data/mockResources.js).

Clicking “Report” updates the resource status locally (using useState).

No real API or backend required — all frontend mockup.

🧪 Extras (Optional if time allows):
Show a loading spinner before data loads.

Add filter buttons above the grid (e.g., All | Available | Occupied).

Animate status badge (e.g., pulsing green/red if recently updated).

Scroll-to-top button.

Footer with “Made for Hackathon 2025”.

✅ Summary
Build a React + Tailwind CSS website named "SpaceKo" for tracking the availability of PUP campus spaces. Use a linen-themed aesthetic (#FAF0E6) with maroon and gold accents. Include a top nav, a grid of space cards (with statuses), a report modal, a static campus map section with a legend, and a sidebar for top contributors. Use mock data only. Make it fully responsive and styled with subtle animations. No backend integration needed yet.
